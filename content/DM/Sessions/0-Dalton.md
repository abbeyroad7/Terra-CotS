#### Story
- #### Forest4
- As you are traveling the dirt road to Aurelia, you hear the scuffled sound of something rumaging through the underbrush. You freeze, and as it draws nearer, you see a brown bear lock eyes with you. Roll for initiative.
- *ROLL-PERCEPTION* As you draw for your weapon, you notice the bear is young, and an arrow is lodged deep into its hind leg.
