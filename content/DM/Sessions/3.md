#### Story
- {SFX-Campfire} Goobert as sentry, Freya short rest. Yeldarb needs long rest for stone's endurance. Borislav long rest.
- {SFX-Dry Leaves} A wandering skunk meanders through the shrubbery, and ambles towards the party, what do you do?
	- If provoked, skunk may spray.
	- If fed, skunk will leave party alone.
	- If ignored, skunk will rummage through packs of sleeping PCs.
- {FX-ForestMorning} {SFX-HorseTrot} After the skunk invasion, the Party travels for 2 straight days by road without incident before arriving to the small textile town of Anmouth, about 40 miles from Aurelia.
- {SFX-GhostShanty} Anmouth is deserted. It appears that the townspeople had left in a hurry as tools and equipment is left strewn throughout the main square. *Skulks have taken residence here and replaced the townspeople, performing menial tasks the citizens used to do. (Celestria is using monsters for war).*
- The party hears a faint whistle as they walk around investigating. {SFX-Creatures\\Whistle Creepy-loop}

- Inside the tavern, the dining table is set with wooden plating with stale bread and *cold, flavorless* potatoes served in the center. Faint smears of blood line the walls and floorboards.
- The church is deserted, yet books of worship are opened upon the pews. Some even appear to be turning.
- Inside the stables, the bodies of horses lay scattered inside. It appears they have all starved to death.

- *Skulk horde lives by bridge, mutilating the remaining corpses from battle. 2 male skulks violently attack the party on approach, horde stays to side depending on outcome of battle. Skulks can only be viewed from reflection of the water.*
- Players come upon the broken bridge where they see the mangled bodies of Gloridian soldiers.
- {SFX-Music\\Ambush}
- Cross bridge and the city of Aurelia comes into view.

Session 4
- A fresh battlefield, littered with Celestrian and Gloridian soldiers.
- Meet {new_NPC} scavenging battlefield. He offers insight of the current city of Aurelia.
- Denizens of Aurelia must pledge allegience to the Order and symbolize so by wearing a dark green armband adorned with the flag of Celestria.
- To go against the Order is to declare yourself an enemy of the state, and be subject to capture and torture.
- Party is given choice to enter city through main gate, east or west side entrance, or through the sewer tunnels (monsters await here).
- Main gate = party is asked for group name. What business do they have here, etc.
- National bank situated on the east-side business district, adjacent to the government district. Order soldiers patrol around here.
- Small skirmishes in the residential district to the west.
