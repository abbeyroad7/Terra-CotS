# Prompt
Generate a session where the party finds Yeldarb in the hut, entranced by a map that swirls when looked upon. The Hilda Stone communicates to the party that they must find her in the Forest of Petrified Trees before it's too late. There will be a medium encounter there.

Hilda will be hiding in a grove not far from this encounter.

After reuniting with Hilda, the party will reach the base of a mountain that blocks their path. They can either go left, up the mountain, or right. There is a mysterious sign that indicates the direction the party should take. Generate a puzzle here hinting which direction to take and the possible path encounters.

The party reaches the Stygian River where they a powerful Specter who guards entrance into Svalgheim.

A powerful specter (Generate a deity-like specter here.) guards the area, claiming it as a crossroads for souls. It offers the party a bargain: "I will grant your party passageway through the Stygian at a cost. Give unto me a piece of your vitality to part into the 9 Hells in which you seek.”

# Story
Each hour in Aiskhel requires a Wisdom saving throw to resist losing a fragment of their essence.

The party begins to feel the toll of Aiskhel’s pull on their spirits, with each failed saving throw or KO manifesting as fatigue, memory loss, or physical weakness. /r 1d3

Freya, -1 CHA
### Intro
*As you looks upon the decrepit hut before you, you notice the material structure seems impossibly old, its thin walls made of twisted wood that creaks and groans.

*Inside, you find Yeldarb seated at a rickety table, his face illuminated by a faint, swirling glow coming from an ancient map sprawled before him. The map seems alive, its ink shifting and twisting as if charting routes to unseen places.*

*Yeldarb is entranced, his eyes glazed over.

Allow party to wake Yeldarb.

*The map's light flickers and pulses, breaking its hold on Yeldarb. The Barbarian collapses, confused but unharmed.*

*You notice Freya's pack begins to glow. The same familiar voice that had warned you in the Citadel's dungeons comes through the Stone, stronger than before.

DC13 to remember Hilda.

*“You must hurry,” she urges. “The Forest of Petrified Trees is not far from here, but the plane’s grip on you grows stronger still. I've left this map for you as a guide. Find me in a marked grove just beyond the red thicket.”*

### The Forest of Petrified Trees
*The party enters the forest, where jagged, fossilized trees fìll your vision.*

DC14 to inspect trees

*On closer inspection, the twisted bark seems to form the anguished visages of forgotten Elves, their mouths frozen in silent screams and eyes hollowed by time. The faces shift subtly in your periphery, their anguished visages growing more pronounced. You feel as though they are watching you.*

Roll initative.

*You notice the color of a deep red, just beyond the corpse of the last fallen tree. It stands out to you, as the only saturation in this place seems to be closer to greyscale.*

Introduce Hilda token. Greyscale.

*You climb the hill to investigate the source of the out-of-place color and recognize the face you had last seen slain back at the Church in Rusthaven. Hilda Goldvein is sitting at the base of yet another oak tree. She smiles up at you as you approach.*

*"It's good to see you're all still alive," she says. "We've little time. I've brought you here to harvest the Seeds of Eidolon, so you can leave this place and fulfill the prophecy of Old."*

She rummages through the withered vegetation and plucks a strange fruit from its stem.

*"Take these with you," she gestures. "When the fruit is eaten, it will grant you the strength to resist the pulls of Aiskhel and later, Svalgheim," her voice trails.*

You harvest seven Seeds of Eidolon.

*"You see, the only recourse for a Live Soul to leave the Tangent Realms is to climb through the Pits of the Nine Hells. Only then, will you find the Ethereal Gateway to the Mortal Coil."*

*"I must again, warn you. The journey through Svalgheim will be of great peril. It is prophecized that only the Goodness of Men can stop the Shadowwalker and I fear it is your lot who has been tasked by the Gods to do so.*

*You continue through the forest with Hilda as your guide.

*"It's been harder for me to peer through the veil lately," she says. "How is my family? Is Matilda doing okay?*

*The grove of trees opens abruptly as you encounter a large mountain that blocks your path. Per Hilda's map, you have arrived to the base of the Aroanian Mountains.*
## Mountain Path
*A weathered signpost stands up ahead, its inscriptions written in an ancient language you cannot decipher. Beneath the text, three arrows point in different directions: east-west and north facing the mountain.*

- **Left/Right:** The party faces a group of spirits in the ravine.
- **Upward Path:** The party must contend with rockslides and Goliath/Satyr spirits.

End session here.

-------
### The Stygian River
*The party’s journey leads them to the Stygian River, a dark and foreboding waterway swirling with the faint glow of trapped souls. At its edge stands a towering, deity-like specter named Maltherion, the River's Keeper. He is cloaked in dark robes that ripple like the ebony water behind him. His form towers above the Stygian, though it does not reveal his true reflection. His face is obscured, save for two piercing eyes that gleam with an unnatural yellow light.*

DC15 Constitution to avoid minds being read. 1d4 vs 1d6

*He bellows to you, "I will grant your party passageway through the Stygian at a cost. Give unto me a piece of your vitality to part into the 9 Hells in which you seek.”*
### Bargain or Battle
The party must decide whether to:
- **Bargain:** Each member sacrifices a small portion of their max HP to pass.
  1d6 HP
- **Refuse and Fight:** Maltherion reveals his true form—a towering amalgam of spectral energy and bone—and the party must force their way through.

If the party bargains, Maltherion honors the agreement and parts the river, creating a temporary bridge of spectral light. If they fight and win, they find a hidden artifact among his remains, granting them insight into Sorvyn’s tower.

--------

It appears as a lake. You cannot see your reflection. It empties into Svalgheim.

DC16 Wisdom saving throw if Specter can read mind.

A powerful specter (Generate a deity-like specter here) guards the area, claiming it as a crossroads for souls. It offers the party a bargain: "I will grant your party passageway through the Stygian at a cost. Give unto me a piece of your vitality to part into the 9 Hells in which you seek.”

The players must decide:
- **Bargain:** Sacrifice some of their vitality (max HP or Wisdom points).
- **Battle:** Defeat the specter, risking exhaustion.
- **Insight:** Use cunning or spells to decipher an alternate path.

## Chapter 3: Descent into Svalgheim

Hilda explains that Svalgheim is a plane of torment ruled by Sorvyn the Necromancer, whose tower looms above the nine circles. The only way out of Svalgheim is to defeat Sorvyn and seize the portal he guards. However, only the living can leave Svalgheim, and Hilda, as a spirit bound to the Leika Stone, cannot accompany them.

To help them prepare for Svalgheim, Hilda reveals a hidden memory within the Leika Stone—a vision of Sorvyn’s tower and the labyrinthine circles surrounding it. The vision gives the party insight into the plane’s structure and hints at Sorvyn’s vulnerabilities, such as his reliance on necromantic artifacts.

## Chapter 4: The Nine Circles of Svalgheim

Each circle of Svalgheim presents a thematic challenge tied to its domain of torment:

1. **The Circle of Shadows:** A labyrinth where light is scarce, filled with shadow demons.
2. **The Circle of Despair:** A wasteland of sinking sand that tests the party’s hope and resolve.
3. **The Circle of Ashes:** Ruins burning with unquenchable fire, guarded by fire elementals.
4. **The Circle of Chains:** A fortress of enslaved souls and spectral wardens.
5. **The Circle of Bones:** A battlefield of undead legions.
6. **The Circle of Thorns:** A forest of cursed flora that ensnares and drains vitality.
7. **The Circle of Lies:** An illusory domain where nothing is as it seems.
8. **The Circle of Silence:** A void where sound and magic are suppressed.
9. **The Circle of Ice:** A frozen wasteland patrolled by frost giants and white dragons.

---

## Chapter 5: The Tower of Sorvyn

The final challenge lies in Sorvyn’s tower. Here, the party confronts his undead minions and unravel his plans to escape Svalgheim. The tower is a maze of traps and arcane wards, culminating in a climactic battle with Sorvyn himself.

During the confrontation, Sorvyn taunts the party with the futility of their mission, revealing the cost of leaving: Hilda must remain behind. Her presence within the Leika Stone has protected the party from the full effects of Aiskhel and Svalgheim, but she cannot pass through the portal with them.

---

## Chapter 6: The Farewell

After defeating Sorvyn, the party activates the portal. Hilda bids them a heartfelt farewell, urging them to live fully and honor her sacrifice. As the portal opens, the plane’s energy surges, threatening to collapse. The party must make a final, desperate escape.

They emerge in the material plane, scarred but alive, carrying the weight of Hilda’s sacrifice and the memories of their harrowing journey through Aiskhel and Svalgheim. The cracked Leika Stone remains, now silent, a bittersweet reminder of the price they paid.
