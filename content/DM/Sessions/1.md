#### Story
- Borislav is departing from the town of Thatchking, riding a carriage to Aurelia looking for work to provide money for his family. He passes Yeldarb walking alongside the main road. The two continue and notice an amorphous blob following them in the shadows (enter Goobert). By nightfall, they all stumble into an inn on the side of the road, 30 verstas outside Anmouth, where they meet the innkeeper Wald and his son Batti.
- A section of Celestrian soldiers enter the inn and begin hounding the innkeeper for free lodging and drink. Things escalate. Give party chance to save inkeeper from execution. If saved, he will tell of latest news of Gloridia and how the Order has besieged Aurelia. If he survives, he will tell of a hidden treasure that he keeps in the City, that the company may retrieve for saving his life.
- Players come upon a fork in the road. A wooden post bearing the map marker is broken. Party goes right toward Aurelia.
