## Story
The party awakens after traveling through the portal into Aiskhel, a plane of existence similar to purgatory. Construct a D&D storyline using the following bullet points and what you know about the campaign from prior prompts:
- The longer they stay in Aiskhel, the more their spirits dissolve into the underworld.
- A ghostly encounter of spirits eager to cling onto life once again.
- The Leika Stone that Freya carries is cracked. Hilda talks through the stone instructing them to reach her. She will have a plan to guide the party out of Aiskhel.
- Upon finding Hilda, she instructs them that they will have to travel from Aiskel to Svalgheim, a plane of existence similar to the Nine Circles of Hell from Dante Alighieri's The Divine Comedy.
- Overlooking Svalgheim is Sorvyn the Necromancer. He uses his tower to loom over the nine circles and reign over his dominion, forever plotting his escape.
- Only the non-dead can leave Svalgheim. They will have to leave Hilda behind at the end.

Expand on Chapter 1: Arrival in Aiskhel.
The group is transplanted into a dreary world. Yeldarb is missing from the group.


## Chapter 1: Arrival in Aiskhel
If party asks about Hell image: *A vision of what's to come.*

*The portal flares with a blinding light, and your senses fall away from you. For a moment, you feel weightless, suspended in an endless void. Then, with a gut-wrenching lurch, you are thrust forward. Or was it through something?*

*The world around you snaps into focus with an unnatural, jarring clarity—a dreary expanse bathed in pale, sickly light. The air feels thick and damp, clinging to your clammy skin. The only force keeping your knees from buckling is the strange earth beneath your feet. The ground feels insubstantial, unreal. Almost as if you're standing on a boundary between reality and a dreamworld.*

*A haunting stillness permeates the realm, broken only by the faint sound of whispers belonging to creatures hidden behind static trees.*

*A deep, instinctual part of you feels the plane’s influence pulling at your very essence, sucking the lifeforce from you.*

Roll for Religion. DC10, Lower rolls are more susceptible to being frightened.

*As the party regains their footing, they immediately notice something amiss: Yeldarb is gone.

*Nearby, you find Yeldarb’s size 16 bootprints in the soft, ashen soil, leading a few paces before abruptly vanishing. The absence of any other trace leaves an unsettling question lingering in the air: did something take him, or did the plane itself consume him?*

*Before they can dwell further, Freya notices the Leika Stone’s surface has cracked, faint greenish light spilling from its fractures. Hilda’s voice crackles weakly from the stone, her words distorted as though spoken through water. “Find me,” she pleads, her tone urgent and filled with an undercurrent of fear. “Aiskhel… it’s feeding on you. Find me before it’s too late.”*

*Hilda’s voice crackles faintly from the Leika Stone, but it is weak, her words distorted as if carried through water. Freya notices the Leika Stone’s surface is cracked, and faint greenish light spills from the fractures. Before you can gather your thoughts, translucent figures drift out of the mist.*

### Encounter: Clinging Spirits
*The spirits are echoes of those who once lived, desperate to experience life again. They beseech the party for aid, attempting to possess their bodies or drain their vitality to delay their own dissolution.*

**Combat/Negotiation Options:**
- Fighting the spirits reveals that they are tied to Aiskhel and cannot be truly destroyed but only temporarily dispersed.
- Persuasion or Arcana checks may allow the party to learn that these spirits can be calmed or directed to rest with proper rites.

*After overcoming the spirits, the Leika Stone glows brighter, and Hilda’s voice becomes clear. She invites the party to find her deeper within Aiskhel. Her guidance is their only hope of escape.*

This ghostly encounter introduces the mechanic that staying in Aiskhel causes the party’s spiritual essence to erode.
Mechanically, each hour in Aiskhel requires a Wisdom saving throw to resist losing a fragment of their essence.

The party begins to feel the toll of Aiskhel’s pull on their spirits, with each failed saving throw or down manifesting as fatigue, memory loss, or physical weakness. /r 1d3

## Chapter 2: The Journey to Hilda

As the party travels through Aiskhel, they encounter increasingly surreal landscapes—a forest of petrified trees that whisper forgotten names, a lake that reflects only what lies beneath the surface, and a crumbling village inhabited by spectral echoes of its former residents.

### Midpoint Encounter: A Test of Will

The party stumbles upon a rift where the boundary between Aiskhel and Svalgheim is thin. A powerful specter guards the area, claiming it as a crossroads for souls. It offers the party a bargain: “Give me a piece of your essence, and I shall tell you how to reach Hilda.”

The players must decide:

- **Bargain:** Sacrifice some of their vitality (max HP or Wisdom points).
    
- **Battle:** Defeat the specter, risking exhaustion.
    
- **Insight:** Use cunning or spells to decipher an alternate path.
    

Eventually, they find Hilda, her essence bound to the fractured Leika Stone. She tells them that escaping Aiskhel requires traversing to Svalgheim, a far more dangerous realm.

## Chapter 3: Descent into Svalgheim

Hilda explains that Svalgheim is a plane of torment ruled by Sorvyn the Necromancer, whose tower looms above the nine circles. The only way out of Svalgheim is to defeat Sorvyn and seize the portal he guards. However, only the living can leave Svalgheim, and Hilda, as a spirit bound to the Leika Stone, cannot accompany them.

To help them prepare for Svalgheim, Hilda reveals a hidden memory within the Leika Stone—a vision of Sorvyn’s tower and the labyrinthine circles surrounding it. The vision gives the party insight into the plane’s structure and hints at Sorvyn’s vulnerabilities, such as his reliance on necromantic artifacts.

## Chapter 4: The Nine Circles of Svalgheim

Each circle of Svalgheim presents a thematic challenge tied to its domain of torment:

1. **The Circle of Shadows:** A labyrinth where light is scarce, filled with shadow demons.
2. **The Circle of Despair:** A wasteland of sinking sand that tests the party’s hope and resolve.
3. **The Circle of Ashes:** Ruins burning with unquenchable fire, guarded by fire elementals.
4. **The Circle of Chains:** A fortress of enslaved souls and spectral wardens.
5. **The Circle of Bones:** A battlefield of undead legions.
6. **The Circle of Thorns:** A forest of cursed flora that ensnares and drains vitality.
7. **The Circle of Lies:** An illusory domain where nothing is as it seems.
8. **The Circle of Silence:** A void where sound and magic are suppressed.
9. **The Circle of Ice:** A frozen wasteland patrolled by frost giants and white dragons.

## Chapter 5: The Tower of Sorvyn

The final challenge lies in Sorvyn’s tower. Here, the party confronts his undead minions and unravel his plans to escape Svalgheim. The tower is a maze of traps and arcane wards, culminating in a climactic battle with Sorvyn himself.

During the confrontation, Sorvyn taunts the party with the futility of their mission, revealing the cost of leaving: Hilda must remain behind. Her presence within the Leika Stone has protected the party from the full effects of Aiskhel and Svalgheim, but she cannot pass through the portal with them.

---

## Chapter 6: The Farewell

After defeating Sorvyn, the party activates the portal. Hilda bids them a heartfelt farewell, urging them to live fully and honor her sacrifice. As the portal opens, the plane’s energy surges, threatening to collapse. The party must make a final, desperate escape.

They emerge in the material plane, scarred but alive, carrying the weight of Hilda’s sacrifice and the memories of their harrowing journey through Aiskhel and Svalgheim. The cracked Leika Stone remains, now silent, a bittersweet reminder of the price they paid.
