# Portal
*Beware the Voidwalker, for when He walks, the false land will unhinge its ravenous maw. For when He walks, the lifeless sky will weep from the blood of stars unseen. For when He walks, the Age of Shadow will envelop us all.*

Soulblade = Expend a charged soul for 1 critical hit.
	The hilt has a subtle grooved inlay for your thumb. When pressed, the soul charge is activated.

*A familiar matronly voice, warns you.

```
Do not tread where shadows deepen,  
For the gates to Svalgheim are hungry.  

In its halls, no light endures,  
And no soul escapes unbroken.  
Turn away, or be claimed.
```
# After they push through:
##### Earthquake.mp3
*A low, melodic drum harkens you forward. Something about the sound speaks to you, pulling you ever closer.

*The scene unfolds into a torchlit staircase, spiraling downward into a dark chamber deep within the bowels of the citadel, where the outside air does not penetrate the stone. The chamber is thick with the musk of earth and incense.*
##### ArcaneEnergy.mp3

*You gaze above you and your eyes focus through a haze of piercing darkness. Flickering braziers cast long, twisted shadows, illuminating a group of hooded cultists. Their robes are black, embroidered in crimson runes that seem to pulse with a malevolent life of their own.

*They chant in low, guttural tones; their voices rising and falling in harmony.*

DC Stealth 12
Inside the chamber there are commoners lined up shackled along the wall. If party is caught, they are tied up as well.

- **Maya Myervs**: Use Slow (Lvl 3) on party as they approach, 6 targets. Hypnotic Pattern on second turn.

*Your eyes narrow onto the female drow who takes lead in the chant. She utters words in a language that is unknown to you. Center-stage, a woman is bound to a worktable, crying in terror. Void emotion, the hooded dark-elf raises a blade and plunges it down into the woman's chest, spurting out a pool of blood. Her last scream curdles through your ears.*

Freya understands the Elvish incantation.
*The Drow continues uttering:

```
Veldrin Valsharess, Olothil Xal'ithar
Waela'quar bluth ulu uns'aa l'olath

F'sarn ulu zaereth,
Sorvyn ilythiiri, dro ulnen phur!
------------------------------
Sovereign of Darkness, Lord of Death
With the flow of blood to shatter the stream,

I summon your essence and your will.
Sorvyn the Eternal, rise onto the Mortal Plane!
```

*On the altar, glowing orbs float above the bodies of their most recent victims—commoners who had been recently killed. The orbs pulse weakly, dimming as they are funneled into an iron-wrought artifact suspended in midair above the altar.

Wood covering conceals pit. Incinerated when Soul Orbs are funneled into the Vortex Anchor.

*The pentagram on the altar begins to burn brightly. The lines begin to swirl, burning with flame as each orb enters, akin to a candle wick being ignited. They rotate faster and faster, seemingly giving an ever-increasing layer of depth to the scrawled symbol.*

*The earth begins to shake violently as the wooden altar tears itself apart, seemingly pulling at the very fabric of reality around it. Each soul draws the vortex wider, cracks beginning to foment like spiderweb across the stone floor.*
##### **DemonFire.mp3**

*A male cultist steps forward, his hands raised high as the ground trembles beneath your feet. "The gateway to Svalgheim is opening!" he bellows, his voice booming with the crackle of Umbra. "Soon, the veil will tear, and the Voidwalker will usher in a world free from sorrow!"

*The pulsing orbs of the departed souls flicker erratically, casting spectral light across the chamber.

*The cultist's chantings rise to a crescendo and trail off as your focus is disrupted by rushing visions of your loved ones.*

*Renroc, you see your father in full military dress, cupping his hand over yours
Freya, you see your ancestors ushering you back into the fire circle.
Goobert, you see your mother pouring a bowl of hot goomeal over an open fire.*
*Scribbles, your family is huddled together in your childhood home, beckoning you to join them with clicks of joy.*
*Yeldarb, you watch your stoic mother, oldened with age and faded tattoos, moved to tears now that her son has returned to her.*
*Borislav, you see your fallen brothers and sisters, joyously communing around the forgotten fields of Zeilona.*

*The dark elf acolyote locks eyes with the party, her expression one of pure serenity. "The Voidwalker beckons," she intones, her voice cutting through the cacophony. "All of your pain, your longing—it can end. Sorvyn will reunite us with those you have lost."*

*As her words hang in the air, the party's visions intensify. They are no longer ghostly specters but vivid and lifelike. The room falls eerily quiet. The only sound, the desperate, yearning calls of your loved ones, echoing in your minds.*

*The cultist who declared the gateway's arrival steps forward. "All we ask is your submission. Embrace the void, and all you desire shall be returned to you."*

### **Player Choice**
1. **Open the Portal and Accept Sorvyn’s Offer**  
    By allowing the cultists to complete the ritual, the gateway to Svalgheim will open. Sorvyn, the Voidwalker, will emerge, and the loved ones they long for will return—but at a cost. The mortal world will suffer under Sorvyn’s rule, the souls of those who died in the ritual lost forever to his dominion.
    
    ##### DemonHaunt.mp3

1. **Interrupt the Ritual to Close the Portal**  
    If they destroy the vortex, slay the cultists, or disrupt the ritual, they can prevent the gateway from opening. However, this will banish the lingering spirits of their loved ones, sealing them away forever. The pull of the vortex will briefly reverse, and the party must pass a CON check (DC 20) to avoid being pulled into Svalgheim themselves.
    
    ##### ScratchWood.mp3

1. **Enter the Underworld**  
    If the party chooses to jump into the vortex willingly, they may halt the ritual from the other side, directly confronting Sorvyn in his realm. Doing so, however, strands them in Svalgheim, leaving them to face its horrors while severing their connection to the material plane.
### **Mechanics of the Encounter**
- **Emotional Strain:** At the start of each player’s turn, they must roll a DC 14 Wisdom saving throw. On a failure, they are overcome by their vision and unable to attack or interfere with the ritual for one turn.
- **Combat Challenge:** The cultists will defend the ritual. Their priority is to delay the party as the ritual progresses.
	- Each round the portal grows more unstable, DEX/Survival saves (DC 10) to avoid falling debris
- **Maya Myervs**:
	- Use Slow (Lvl 3) on party as they approach, 6 targets. Hypnotic Pattern on second turn.
	- 3 soul charges
### **Outcome**
- **If Sorvyn Emerges:** The gateway fully opens, flooding the material plane with shadow energy. Sorvyn erupts out of the Portal and passes through the ceiling.
- **If the Ritual is Stopped:** The cultists are defeated or driven back, and the vortex collapses. The souls of the victims dissipate, lost forever. The room falls into an eerie silence, and the weight of their choice presses heavily upon the party.
- **If They Enter the Underworld:** The party is transported to Svalgheim, an unforgiving realm of darkness. Their journey becomes a quest to return to the material plane while facing Sorvyn and the challenges of the void.
