- Pressure plate on bottom of ladder rung, DEX saving throw, 2d8 dmg
- Main passage with rough-hewn stone walls and low-hanging roots
- Fork in the tunnel: The left path is narrow and seems less traveled, while the right path is wider and shows signs of recent use.
- The right path has a hidden pit trap covered by loose stones. Falling into the pit deals damage and requires an Athletics check to climb out.

- A small room off the main passage, filled with old crates and barrels.
- Some barrels contain dwarven ale, while others hold spoiled rations and rusted tools.
- **Trap:** One of the crates has a spring-loaded blade trap that triggers when opened, requiring a Dexterity saving throw to avoid being cut.

- **Hidden Sanctuary:**
- A secret chamber accessible through a hidden door in one of the side tunnels.
- The sanctuary is a safe haven with a small pool of fresh water, a makeshift bed, and supplies.
- **Trap:** The door to the sanctuary is trapped with a glyph of warding that triggers a burst of radiant energy if not disarmed properly.

- **Escape Tunnel:**
- A tunnel leading out of the network, emerging in a secluded spot in the woods outside Feytown.
