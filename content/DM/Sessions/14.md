#### Hideout
- *The party is led to Renroc's hideout, a nondescript building in the heart of Rusthaven. Inside, the air is thick with the scent of old books and Hearth-Dwarven herbs. You find your eyes fixate upon a dwarven women with a warm gaze. She tilts her head, studying your party and you see a flicker of recognition in her eyes.*
- *"I have heard your party in my flashes.'"*
- She will commend the party's bravery traveling to these lands and commitment to helping her family.
- *As the river flows unceasing, so too will your journey wind and bend.*
- *Please make yourselves comfortable and rest awhile. We will talk more in the morning.

- *Hours pass, and in the middle of the night, you hear a soft click come from the door.*

- *Hilda will come to meet Freya, Stopping just short of an Elvish arms-length, the irises of Hilda's eyes cloud over.
- *Freya, noticing her bag alight with blue embers, reaches into her bag and cups the Vision Stone between her palms.*
- *While you're watching these events unfold, you can't help but notice Freya's bag smells like river water.*
- *A shiver courses down Freya's spine, but she is unable to move as Hilda falls to her knees and grabs hold of the stone.

- *Between short-breaths, Hilda appears visibly shaken. She turns to Renroc, and instructs him to get everyone upstairs as soon as possible. There is no time to waste.*
#### Church
- The party will travel up a stone staircase leading to a delapidated church, its once grand architecture now crumbling.
- *You notice dim lanterns illuminating the center stage, which Hilda climbs onto to address a small and confused crowd.*
- Her face sullen and aged what seems like years from hours before, Hilda speaks softly at first, heavy with a hint of sorrow: *For many moons, I've listened to the Whisper. It has foretold to me events far and wide, unrelenting in its honest visage (viz-ige). Its latest tellings are marred by the despair of our once beautiful city and the good people that live here. One message, keeps repeating itself through the fog.*
- *Beware the Voidwalker, for when He walks, the false land will unhinge its ravenous maw. For when He walks, the lifeless sky will weep from the blood of stars unseen. For when He walks, the Age of Shadow will envelop us all.*
- Kaldor Steelhide, a well-respected civil leader in Rusthaven, stands and questions the prophecy.
	- *What does this mean?* the crowd murmurs
	- *Should we leave Aurelia?*
- Hilda responds with conviction: *The future is uncertain, but from what I've heard, I believe leaving would be a mistake. No one will be safe from the Voidwalker.*

- *In the distance, you hear a far-off crow cawing.* Allow Scribbles to roll DC15 for perception.
	- The feathers on the back of your neck stand up in anticipation.
- *Suddenly, an explosion rocks the building, caving in the wall to the left.*
