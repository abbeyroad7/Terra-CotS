- Discuss Hilda's prophecy
	- *For many moons, I've listened to the Whisper. It has foretold to me events far and wide, unrelenting in its honest visage (viz-ige). Its latest tellings are marred by the despair of our once beautiful city and the good people that live here. One message, keeps repeating itself through the fog. Beware the Voidwalker, for when He walks, the false land will unhinge its ravenous maw. For when He walks, the lifeless sky will weep from the blood of stars unseen. For when He walks, the Age of Shadow will envelop us all.*
