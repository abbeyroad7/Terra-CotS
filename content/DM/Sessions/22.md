## Weapon Depot
*The party sneaks into a massive stone-walled chamber with shelves lined with blades, shields, and armor, all meticulously arranged. The air is thick with the scent of oiled steel and a static discharge. Lit sconces flicker an eerie glow over the arsenal, glinting off polished metal and reflecting the intricate runes engraved onto the weapons.*

*As the party moves deeper into the depot, they hear faint whispers of incantations echoing from a dimly lit backroom. The door is ajar, and through the crack, you can see a robed sorcerer, standing in the center of the chamber. His hands are raised over a sword, the blade floating in mid-air, surrounded by crackling arcs of arcane energy. Runes glow on the weapon, pulsing in rhythm with the sorcerer’s chant. Surrounding him are a dozen other weapons—spears, axes, and daggers—each suspended in the air, waiting their turn to be infused with deadly enchantments.*

*The sorcerer is alone, his focus entirely on the task before him, unaware of the party’s presence. Nearby, a large tome lies open on a stone table, detailing complex arcane formulas and rituals. Several crystals hum with magical energy, amplifying his enchantments. You realize you are witnessing something significant.*
## Room Loot

##### Branching Plot Points:
1. **Confront the Sorcerer (Combat/Negotiation)**
    - The party can burst in, weapons drawn, and challenge the sorcerer. This could lead to a tough battle, as the sorcerer could use the half-enchanted weapons as magical constructs, animating them to attack. The depot itself might become a battlefield as swords fly off the shelves, striking at the party.
2. **Sabotage the Enchantments (Stealth/Skill Challenge)**
    - If the party wants to avoid confrontation, they could sneak around and attempt to sabotage the weapons. Disrupting the magic circle or tampering with the crystals could cause the enchantments to backfire, potentially damaging the Citadel’s weapons supply.
    - Success might lead to a weakened enemy force when the party faces them later. However, failure could result in the sorcerer detecting them, triggering combat or an alarm, which would summon guards to the depot.
3. **Steal Enchanted Weapons (Risk/Reward)**
    - The party might be tempted to steal some of the enchanted weapons. These could be powerful tools in future encounters, but tampering with the sorcerer’s work could have unpredictable consequences. Some of the weapons might be unstable, cursed, or incomplete, leading to unexpected effects in battle.
    - If they succeed, the party gains new magical gear. If they fail, they could set off magical traps or trigger an enchantment that backfires on them.
4. **Discover Hidden Intel (Exploration/Investigation)**
    - The backroom holds more than just enchanted weapons. If the party takes the time to investigate, they might find notes or schematics revealing the Citadel’s plans. The sorcerer could have information on the cultists’ next moves, or the enchantments could be part of a larger plot to arm an army with soul-draining weapons.
	- The backroom is filled with arcane symbols etched into the floor, casting a faint glow. Shelves are stacked with raw materials—magical gems, rare herbs, and vials of strange liquids—all components for powerful enchantments. The faint hum of magic resonates in the air, as if the very walls are charged with energy. The closer the party gets to the sorcerer, the more they feel a tingling sensation on their skin, as the air itself seems to vibrate with latent power.
## Coven of Celestria
- Coven starts their chanting to open Portal
- Party is thrown into the [[Everstream]] if attempt to disrupt ritual. DC10 CON group roll
# Portal
*Beware the Voidwalker, for when He walks, the false land will unhinge its ravenous maw. For when He walks, the lifeless sky will weep from the blood of stars unseen. For when He walks, the Age of Shadow will envelop us all.*

For Sorvyn to enter the Mortal Coil, the chasm requires a leader and his followers to fall into his place in Svalgheim.

Soulblade = Expend a charged soul for 1 critical hit.
	The hilt has an subtle grooved inlay for your thumb. When pressed, the soul charge is activated.

*You enter into another long hallway. A low, melodic drum harkens you forward. Something about the sound speaks to you, pulling you ever closer.

Freya is holding the Leika Stone.
*A familiar matronly voice, warns you.

*Do not tread where shadows deepen,*  
*For the gates to Svalgheim are hungry.*  

*In its halls, no light endures,*  
*And no soul escapes unbroken.*  
*Turn away, or be claimed*

------------------------------

You struggle to resist yourself (DC15 CON) and push through the chamber doors and enter into the portal room.*

# After they push through:
*You gaze above you and your eyes focus through a haze of piercing darkness. A level above you, a concentrated drow is uttering words in a language that is unknown to you. You see a woman bound to the worktable crying in terror. Void emotion, the dark-elf raises a blade and plunges it down into the woman's chest, spurting out a pool of blood. Her last scream curdles through your ears.*

*Khaless d'natha quortek, khaless d'thah,*  
*Xal l'oloth kyorl dosst sseren ghil.*  
*Ilharess l'dalninuk xal elgg vel'bolen zhal'la,*  
*Usstan gol'ro l'jal dossta ssinssrin ulu kyorl jal!*

*F'sarn ulu xal'zaereth, ulu velkyn ulu tlun,*  
*Sorvyn ilythiiri, dro ulnen phor!*

------------------------------
*Mistress of war, Sovereign of Darkness,*  
*House of shadows and watchful blades.*  
*Blood flows to empower the abyss,*  
*I summon your essence and your will.*

*The power of a storm, the power of death,*  
*Let the shadows open their gaze here.*  
*Lady of chaos, let mortal laws shatter,*  
*I offer this gift for your return to reign!*

*From ash to eternity, to darkness to being,*  
*Sorvyn Eternal, rise once more!*

Sorvyn can bring back your dead loved ones.
*Renroc, you see your father laden in military armor and medals, smiling at you.* 
*Freya, you see your family ushering you back into the fire circle.*
*Goobert, you see your mother and father warming a warm meal over a hearth.*
*Scribbles, your family is flying overhead, beckoning you to join them with their clicks of joy.*
*Yeldarb, you see your forever-stoic mother, crying tears of happiness that her son has returned to her.*

*The scene unfolds in a dark, decrepit temple deep within the bowels of the citadel, where the outside air cannot penetrate the stone. The air is heavy with the must of earth and incense, swirling with an ominous energy.*

*At the center of the temple, a large stone altar, slick with blood, stands beneath an ancient symbol etched into the cracked wall. Flickering braziers cast long, twisted shadows, illuminating a group of hooded cultists. Their robes are black, embroidered with crimson runes that seem to pulse with a malevolent life of their own. Chanting in low, guttural tones, their voices rise and fall in harmony with the unholy ritual they are performing.*

*On the altar, glowing orbs float above the bodies of their most recent victims—commoners who had been recently killed. The orbs pulse weakly, dimming as they are funneled into a swirling vortex that hovers above the altar. The vortex is an unnatural void and seems to pull at the very fabric of reality. Each new soul draws the vortex wider, and cracks begin to spiderweb across the temple floor.*

*The head cultist steps forward, his hands raised high as the ground trembles beneath the party's feet. "The gateway to Svalgheim is opening!" he bellows, his voice booming with the crackle of Umbra. "Soon, the veil will tear, and the Voidwalker will usher the world a New Age!"
