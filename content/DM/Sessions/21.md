- #### Weapons depot
The party sneaks into a massive stone-walled chamber with shelves lined with blades, shields, and armor, all meticulously arranged. The air is thick with the scent of oiled steel and a static discharge. Lit sconces flicker an eerie glow over the arsenal, glinting off polished metal and reflecting the intricate runes engraved on some of the weapons.

As the party moves deeper into the depot, they hear faint whispers of incantations echoing from a dimly lit backroom. The door is ajar, and through the crack, they can see a robed sorcerer, standing in the center of a magic circle. His hands are raised over a sword, the blade floating mid-air, surrounded by crackling arcs of arcane energy. Runes glow on the weapon, pulsing in rhythm with the sorcerer’s chant. Surrounding him are a dozen other weapons—spears, axes, and daggers—each suspended in the air, waiting their turn to be infused with deadly enchantments.

The sorcerer is alone, his focus entirely on the task before him, unaware of the party’s presence. Nearby, a large tome lies open on a stone table, detailing complex arcane formulas and rituals. Several crystals hum with magical energy, amplifying his enchantments. The party realizes they are witnessing something significant.

### Branching Plot Points:

1. **Confront the Sorcerer (Combat/Negotiation)**
    - The party can burst in, weapons drawn, and challenge the sorcerer. This could lead to a tough battle, as the sorcerer could use the half-enchanted weapons as magical constructs, animating them to attack. The depot itself might become a battlefield as swords fly off the shelves, striking at the party.
    - Alternatively, the party might try to negotiate. The sorcerer could reveal that he’s not aligned with the cultists but is instead an enslaved mage forced to work on the Citadel’s arsenal. He might offer information or magical items in exchange for his freedom.
2. **Sabotage the Enchantments (Stealth/Skill Challenge)**
    - If the party wants to avoid confrontation, they could sneak around and attempt to sabotage the weapons. Disrupting the magic circle or tampering with the crystals could cause the enchantments to backfire, potentially damaging the Citadel’s weapons supply.
    - Success might lead to a weakened enemy force when the party faces them later. However, failure could result in the sorcerer detecting them, triggering combat or an alarm, which would summon guards to the depot.
3. **Steal Enchanted Weapons (Risk/Reward)**
    - The party might be tempted to steal some of the enchanted weapons. These could be powerful tools in future encounters, but tampering with the sorcerer’s work could have unpredictable consequences. Some of the weapons might be unstable, cursed, or incomplete, leading to unexpected effects in battle.
    - If they succeed, the party gains new magical gear. If they fail, they could set off magical traps or trigger an enchantment that backfires on them.
4. **Discover Hidden Intel (Exploration/Investigation)**
    
    - The backroom holds more than just enchanted weapons. If the party takes the time to investigate, they might find notes or schematics revealing the Citadel’s plans. The sorcerer could have information on the cultists’ next moves, or the enchantments could be part of a larger plot to arm an army with soul-draining weapons.
	- The backroom is filled with arcane symbols etched into the floor, casting a faint glow. Shelves are stacked with raw materials—magical gems, rare herbs, and vials of strange liquids—all components for powerful enchantments. The faint hum of magic resonates in the air, as if the very walls are charged with energy. The closer the party gets to the sorcerer, the more they feel a tingling sensation on their skin, as the air itself seems to vibrate with latent power.
	- A hidden lever may be found, unveiling a hidden chamber

The scene unfolds in a dark, decrepit temple deep within an overgrown forest, where the light of the moon barely penetrates the thick canopy. The air is heavy with the scent of damp earth and incense, swirling with an ominous energy.

At the center of the temple, a large stone altar, slick with blood, stands beneath an ancient symbol etched into the cracked wall. Flickering braziers cast long, twisted shadows, illuminating a group of hooded cultists. Their robes are black, embroidered with crimson runes that seem to pulse with a malevolent life of their own. Chanting in low, guttural tones, their voices rise and fall in harmony with the unholy ritual they are performing.

On the altar, glowing orbs float above the bodies of their most recent victims—commoners who had been recently killed. The orbs pulse weakly, dimming as they are funneled into a swirling vortex that hovers above the altar. The vortex is an unnatural void and seems to pull at the very fabric of reality. Each new soul draws the vortex wider, and cracks begin to spiderweb across the temple floor.

The head cultist steps forward, his hands raised high as the ground trembles beneath the party's feet. "The gateway to the underworld is opening!" he bellows, his voice booming with dark magic. "Soon, the veil will tear, and our dark lord shall walk among the living!"

At this moment, the party can see glimpses of shadowy, monstrous figures clawing at the edges of the vortex, eager to break through. The air hums with dark energy, and the temperature drops as frost begins to form on the stone walls. The cultists continue their chanting, oblivious to the approaching heroes, who must act quickly to stop the ritual before the underworld breaches into the mortal realm.
