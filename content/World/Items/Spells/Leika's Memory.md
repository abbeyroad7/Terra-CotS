Requires: Leika's Stone
Level 3 Spell

By incantation, this spell invokes [[Leika, the Trickster God]] to conjure a glimpse into the past for a location that the caster is physically present in. The caster may request a specific timeframe in the location's history.

Due to Leika's nature, the vision may or may not reveal an accurate representation of the unfolded events.
