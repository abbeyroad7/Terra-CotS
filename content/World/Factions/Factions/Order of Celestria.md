# Background
The rebellion forces invading Aurelia. They are seeking to establish order and destroy all remaining magic from the lands, as they have deemed the ruling Gloridian government had developed a laissez-faire approach to the [[Arcane Question]].

Authoritarian in nature, they do not have qualms with slavery, forced curfews, and mandatory conscription.

Followers of the God, [[Thalos, God of Order|Thalos]].
