# Introduction
Goobert is an adult Plasmoid and rogue. He specializes in thievery and uses his gel-like body to squeeze into tight spaces. His pathology revolves around helping those that help him - that is, until he is physically threatened.

# Background
Goobert grew up living in a large city and was ostracized for 'looking different'. He could never find a job and resorted to living in the sewers and using the sewer system to pull off heists. After a heist-gone-wrong, he's currently on the run after getting caught robbing the mayor.

# Evolution
Following his 4th level advancement, Goobert became interested in the arts of becoming an Artificer.
