# Background
Gunnar Goldvein is an adult hearth-dwarf originally from [[Aurelia|Aurelia's]] Highfall District. He is father to [[Matilda Goldvein]] and widowed to his wife, Mya. Mya Goldvein had been one of the first killed in [[The Witchfire Crusades]] after the [[Arcane Authority]] concluded she had prophetic abilities.

As a hearth-dwarf, Gunnar is privy to the skill of the dwarven culinary art. As such, he's proudly taken up the stead as the [[Arcane Liberation Front|ALF's]] hearty house-steward and chef.
