**Alignment Rationale:** Vinara is aligned as chaotic good because while she values freedom, creativity, and the flourishing of life, she is not bound by rigid laws or structures. Her chaotic nature reflects the wild and untamed aspects of nature, while her alignment with good signifies her benevolent intentions towards the world and its inhabitants.

Players who worship Vinara or seek her favor might be druids, rangers, or clerics with a focus on nature, life, or storm domains, or anyone who appreciates the beauty and bounty of nature, especially in its cultivated forms like vineyards and orchards.
