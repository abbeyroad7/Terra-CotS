When we first started this campaign in the February of 2024, myself as DM and the original players had convened together to establish what the game will look like in terms of gameplay.

This Session 0 reflects the tone of our campaign and I would refer any new players to these guidelines so they can know what to expect when joining our world.

## Player Behavior
Please understand that this is a game, and I try my best to make it fun and excitable for my players, so just don't be a dick. We play digitally, so eating, bathroom breaks, answers calls/texts are to be expected, but try and stay focused during the game, and if you need to step away for any reason, try and not to be too distracting to your fellow players.
## PvP
For many of us, this campaign is our first introduction to DND. The original idea of starting this campaign is to have an outlet for all of us to keep contact, and work together as a group and to go on wacky adventures while doing it. PvP defeats that purpose and as such, is expressly forbidden at the table.
## Tone
The overall tone of this campaign is to be light-hearted and fun. I will introduce elements of horror and violence at times, as this is Dungeons and Dragons, but I still want the game to be rooted in friendship and cooperation.
## Scheduling
We will honor a biweekly schedule every other Tuesday at 7pm. This schedule is contingent on the availabilty of everyone, so it may change in the future.

If some players are unavailable, we will continue the session unless we bypass a minimum of 3 players.

## Longevity
I would like to build this world out as much as I can, and get it to be a year-long endeavor with everyone. I understand long story arcs may not be the most feasible however, so I will dedicate Chapters to our sessions. I'm currently planning each chapter to be no more than a year long.
