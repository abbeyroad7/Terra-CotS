## Introduction
Around the campfire, it is customary to cook, eat and drink. This homebrew supplementary rule covers foraging/hunting for culinary ingredients and the fine art of cooking.
## Foraging
Players can search the lands for native vegetables and spices that can be used to embolden known dishes for their character's palette.
## Hunting
In addition, players can choose to extract animal parts to use them alongside other ingredients. The rarity of certain meats can prove to make certain dishes into delicacies for characters. Though some meats should remain off the kitchen table...
### Cooking Process
Recipes can be cooked over a fire during a short or long rest. The amount of portions created depends on each recipe, and they become inedible **2 days** after being cooked, unless preserved. Consuming a portion takes as little as 1 minute and you are able to eat another portion after 4 hours.

**At the end of the cooking time, you must make a Wisdom check, adding your proficiency bonus if you are proficient with Cook's utensils. This is a Cooking check.**

**Recipe DCs are calculated based on the complexity of the dishes as well as the durability of the ingredients being handled.**
- For example, a simple ham-sandwich may require a DC3 to prepare, but an Elvish herbed duck-cutlet may require a DC16 to prepare adequately.

On a success, you can create the amount of meals you chose. On a failure, all ingredients are wasted, and the meal provides no additional effects and/or becomes inedible, scaling with the value of the roll.

#### Simple Recipes
These recipes do not require a kitchen, and can be cooked on a campfire or similar source of heat. They include eggs, meats, and stews. These recipes take **0.5 hours** to cook.
#### Complex Recipes
These recipes require a kitchen to be cooked. They include broths, desserts, pastries, and soups. These recipes take **2 hours** to cook.
### Gaining Recipes
A character with proficiency in Cooking utensils starts with 3 simple recipes and 2 complex recipe of their choice. To acquire more recipes, there are a multitude of avenues:
- Native dishes in accordance to their race/class background
- Reading or being taught by another character.
- Experimentation, as explained below.

Once a recipe is known, a character knows the full description of a recipe including the Failure Effect.

### Experimentation
In order to teach yourself a recipe, you must spend the full Cooking time experimenting to the creation of a recipe. During this time, you must have access to fresh samples of the ingredients as well as a source of heat or fire.

At the end of the Cooking time, you must succeed a Cooking check with Disadvantage, or suffer the failure effect of the recipe, scaling in accordance to your roll.

Once a recipe is completed, the ingredients are consumed, and that recipe becomes known to your character.
### Culinary Effects
In addition to the satiating effects of typical rations, some recipes provide additional buffs in respect to their taste and fulfillment.

For example, a rare dish may provide additional Inspiration to the party when consumed and some culinary ingredients may provide temporary bonuses in respect to their origin.
