# Bank Vault
Upon returning to ALF-HQ, the party was commended for bringing back the fae prisoners, [[Elli Peer]] and [[Puck]].

Soon after, Borislav's hip began to suspiciously warm and pulsate with a faint blue light. After rummaging through his pockets, he revealed the golden key that the party had been gifted from saving [[Batti Knave, Innkeeper|Batti]] and [[Wald Knave, Innkeeper|Wald]] at the [[Knave's Scroll]].

Upon further study, [[Goobert]] revealed that the key bore an origin bereft of the old artisans from before [[The Arcanum Wars]]. [[Rasha Moonstar|Rasha]] began pouring over the ancient texts to match the old key. He returned to the party a short-while later, informing them that the key's handle bears an insignia that of the Gods, and warns them of the possible dangers of unlocking the vault it belongs to.

The party went to the [[Aurelian National Bank]]. Celestrian guarded the bank. The party was asked for documentation and Yeldarb loudly proclaimed himself a kinsmen of the Knaves and was asked for documentation.
