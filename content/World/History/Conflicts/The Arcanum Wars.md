### Background
The Arcanum Wars were a series of global conflicts immediately following [[The Divine Restoration]] in 1388 [[Terra Calendar (TC)|TC]] and ultimately ending nearly 200 years later in 1564 TC. It was the single most divisive and destructive period of history since the [[World/History/Conflicts/Cataclysm of the Shattered|Cataclysm of the Shattered]].

After [[Arilias]] defeated [[Sorvyn]], the all-powerful God drew a deep breath inviting the waters of the [[Leyaub Ocean]] to quench the exposed magma left in the wake of their final battle. This created the [[Perlas Sea]] to the south of modern-day [[Thorq]] and [[Balfran]], which tragically engulfed what was once entire countries home to millions of peoples.

These events led to a continued global instability as regional powers vied for control of the newly-forged peninsula. Some sought to unbury the vast deposit of Arcana, while others tried to defend it at all costs. After countless, empty searches through the decades, the deposit settled into the common mythos, as the [[Den of Necromancy]].

### Conclusion
The end of the Arcanum Wars came when the lands of [[Thorq]] and [[Balfran]] signed a mutual Defense Pact with the [[Westler|Duchy of Westler]]. Nearly 70 years of global peace flourished, as a renaissance of human and dwarf-led technology flourished with the decline of Arcane energy.
