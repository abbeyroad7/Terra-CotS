Sorvyn, the Necromancer, born of unknown origin and age, was a formidable wielder of dark arts, who aspired to ascend mortality and claim Godhood. Through the manipulation of arcane energies and the forbidden arts of necromancy, he sought to consolidate all the Arcana of the world, believing he would be able to reshape reality and time at will.

Driven by his thirst for dominion, Sorvyn sought to usurp the Gods and rule with absolute authority, wielding the Power of Creation as his scepter. His journey was treacherous and malicious, leaving a wake of decay wherever he went, as he pursued the ultimate quest for apotheosis.
